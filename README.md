# rootWrapper

Here, I've implemented a basic wrapper class in python for the CERN ROOT data analysis framework. 

The wrapper combines the TH1D histogram class and TGraphErrors/TGraphAsymmErrors classes to make a unified graph class. This can make it easier (or at least shorter) to fill and style the histogram and its errors. Also, I have struggled with ROOT documentation, so hopefully this repo can help people learn more about how a few of these functions work. Let me know if you have any questions!
